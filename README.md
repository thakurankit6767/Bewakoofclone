These efforts are integrated right into our day-to-day operations, from rainwater harvesting to paper packaging to employee benefits. To create an accessible, affordable and thoughtful experience of online shopping in India.
We used HTML and CSS for styling the website and some hover effects to the buttons on the page. JavaScript DOM and LocalStorage.
HTML5: It is used to build the basic structure of the website. All headings, Paragraphs, links, forms, etc. were structured by HTML.
CSS: It is used to add styling to the website. We used Advance CSS for Animation, Popup Modal window for login/Sign up, Payment, and for adding Address.
JavaScript: It is used to add logical functionalities to the webpages like the onClick function, DOM, and dynamic aspects of the webpage. We used localStorage to store products and Login Details. We have added all the functionalities.
Some Snapshots of Website:
Landing Page: On Landing Page,there was a Dropdown Function and Animation in the top heading and the carousal effect of images. We achieved all functionalities. ðŸ‘‡

Login/Signup Page: Users wonâ€™t be able to see products and add them to the cart without logging in or creating an account. and Login and Sign up data will go to Local Storage. ðŸ‘‡

In Landing Page There are also a Slider products button where I face problem to making that functionality. after watching google and Youtube I make it that also. ðŸ‘‡

In Product Page There Also Face Some Issues My Teamate But After Implementing That We get Our successful Output. ðŸ‘‡
Product Details page we face a lots of problem like not getting the local storage after sometimes collab with me. Then We resolve also that problem in some hours. ðŸ‘‡


Cart Page: User can Increase and decrease the number of products on the cart page, After, Add an address for placing order and Payment Process. ðŸ‘‡

In Payment Page we have a hard code data and without full details we canâ€™t go for Otp page ðŸ‘‡

This has been a great and wonderful experience. Iâ€™m so grateful for getting this opportunity, work with a collaborative team. There were some confusing situations that occurred while merging the pages. But Teamwork made it possible.
Thank You for reading.
